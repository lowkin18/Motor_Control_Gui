# Motor Control from a C# WPF GUI

Chris Kerluke


This was written quickly for the sole purpose of being able to control the speed and velocity profile of a motor through a graphical
user interface.

I utilized my previous knowledge in C# and WPF to quickly build a graphical keypad to avoid wiring up a keypad to my MSP430

The program can dynamically find the COM ports and based on the user selection it will open a connection to the device and begin
sending serial data when updated with new commands
